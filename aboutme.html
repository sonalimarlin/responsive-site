    <h2> Senior Consultant <br>KPMG Consulting</h2>
      <p>For almost 4 years, I was a Senior Consultant with one of the big 5 accounting/consulting firms, KMPG Consulting. Almost every week, I traveled to various cities across the US, working on diverse client assignments. From Requirements Documentation and Project Management, to Product Manager for a telecommunications company in Denver, to optimizing a call center, to working on a CRM project in Washington D.C.</p>

    <h2> Director, Project Management <br>Markit On Demand</h2>
      <p>I worked at IHS Markit (then known as Wall Street On Demand and later Markit On Demand) for little over 6 years, as project manager. I worked with numerous financial clients, building webp-based financial products like stock screeners, stock and mutual fund pages, graphs and charts and other investment-related pages. As one of the directors of Project Management, I met with clients for sales proposals and pitches, and also managed all stages of the software development lifecycle. </p>

    <h2> Freelance Project Management <br> Goosetail Labs</h2>
      <p>Ultimately, being the middleman-who-does-not-actually-build-anything got a little frustrating. While it was nice to get recognition for projects that went well (the glamorous part), I wanted to be experiencing the power of actually building content. I found myself dabbling in "QA", by reading javascript code, finding issues using debug tools, running SQL queries to debug data issues. I had some development experience from way back in MBA school, but circumstances had made me pursue a different line of work. I decided to forge off into a new direction and did a bit of free-lance consulting while I re-trained to be a developer.</p>

    <h1> Software Development Education </h1>
        <p>Which brings me to the here and now, and my re-education/re-introduction to the world of coding!</p>
          <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
          <p>My first step was to to teach myself basic HTML and CSS, using a book recommended by an awesome developer friend: Head First HTML and CSS. It was a great start.</p>
          <h3> Javascript</h3>
          <p> I then headed into Javascript territory, using 2 books:
            <ol>
              <li>A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript By Mike Myers</li>
              <li>Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
            <h3>jQuery</h3>
            <p>I learned the basics of jQuery using another book written by Mark Myers, called "A Smarter Way to Learn jQuery"</p>
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>I enrolled in an introduction to programming workshop through "Girl Develop It" and learned the basic syntax of Python programming. The book I used was a free online text by Real Python</p>
